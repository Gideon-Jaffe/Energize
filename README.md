This game was made using unity and C#.

It was designed and created for the game jam 1-BIT JAM #2.
It is completelty black and white and was designed with the theme of "You start with everything and end with nothing"

In the game there are 5 levels. After completing every level you lose one of your abilities, so for every level you have less options untill the last level where you only have one option.

The C# code is in "Assets/Scripts/"

Enjoy.
